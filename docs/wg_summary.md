RCN Working Groups (WG) focuses on an objective of the RCN such as improved observations or multi-disciplinary collaboration.
They produce reports clearly identifying the issues, approaches, impacts and recommendations for achieving the objective(s).
Working groups have a defined term of reference, generally twelve months (renewable), to assess issues and then submit their recommendations for review by the RCN Plenary, which meets annually in December. â€¯
In their deliberations, the working groups invite external experts to make presentations and provide background on issues being addressed.
The reviewed recommendations will be provided to international, national and program level organizations for consideration and possible implementations.

Previous and current WGs in the RCN include Open Data, RSS-Insitu observations and Citizen Science.
In addition the RCN supported the IOOC Biological Integration and Observation Task Team (BIO-TT) that addressed requirements and capabilities for biology observations.

The reviewed recommendations are be provided to international, national and program level organizations for consideration and possible implementations.
