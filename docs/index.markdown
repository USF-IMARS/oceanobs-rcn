The goal of the RCN:OceanObsNetwork is to evaluate the strategies by which we place relevant information about the ocean in the hands of those that require it, when they require it. 
Reaching this goal involves a broad, multi-disciplinary dialogue to evaluate whether we are collecting the right data or not for scientific and for decision-making purposes. 
The RCN will carry out activities to re-envision what ocean observations are needed for decision making, as opposed to just seeking to increase use of and trust in what we already collect. 
The activities will bring together experts from the natural and social sciences, and include end users of observations that may be policy and decision makers without strong backgrounds in the ocean sciences. 
The RCN will engage young investigators in these activities to help develop future leaders. 
This will enable wider and more effective long-term use of ocean observatories and observing systems consistent with and supporting the goals of the existing frameworks of GEO, GOOS, OOI, IOOS and other national and international efforts.

## OceanObs Network objectives
* Motivate commitments to sustaining ocean and marine observing systems, identifying investments with the highest potential payoff;
* Promote community consensus around broad synergistic concepts that require the concurrent observation of physical, biogeochemical, and biological observations, specifically to address questions in the context of life on Earth;
* Broaden collaborations in ocean science, engineering, technology, and applications, including international private sector, government, and academic elements. This must be a focused effort as the range of issues is too broad for the RCN to address comprehensively;
* Stimulate inter-disciplinary cooperation for observations and synthesis, cutting across the natural and social sciences to improve the flow of critical ocean observation information to key stakeholders (co-design of observation networks and synthesis of results)- this is a path to encourage co-design by building one or more examples of successful implementation;
* Identify the needs, opportunities and barriers to improved/expanded industry involvement in ocean observations, and develop the ‘value proposition/business case’ for this in collaboration with the private sector;
* Work with industry groups (e.g. WOC and PEMSEA) to ensure that ocean observations have broader impact and value, especially in the new blue economy;
* Identify requirements and opportunities to advance the open exchange and access to ocean data - this includes collaboration with ongoing and potential projects;
* Broaden research in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and other strategies to promote interoperability between sensors and other observation technologies, between information systems, and between people using ocean information;
Stimulate capacity building, ocean science leadership, and retention in ocean and marine observations community.

--------------------------------------------------------

**The major challenges to success in the coming decade may be overcome by providing the right information in time to address relevant problems, through improved international and national organizational structures to build and sustain a truly interdisciplinary, coherent, systematic, sustained ocean observing system.**

--------------------------------------------------------

**The OceanObsNetwork will be an organized international forum for linking ocean observatories and ocean observations systems with a broader set of stakeholders from the private, academic, and government sectors.**

--------------------------------------------------------


**The OceanObsNetwork workshops address strategic and technical factors, involving senior as well as young members of the community in addressing broad problems of global relevance. They are opportunities to build a multidisciplinary community of practice.**

## Broader Impacts

The broader impacts of the RCN are significant at multiple levels. 
The RCN has been and will continue to stimulate collaboration across disciplines at an international level. 
An important outcome will be the linkages among a broader set of disciplines in ocean and other sciences, including the natural and social sciences, to address a set of common goals. 

*The close coordination of observing systems is essential for a broader community of stakeholders and to address ocean impacts comprehensively. 
Linking observations from different observing infrastructure, including satellites and aircraft, cabled observatories, drifting and moored buoys, and automated airborne and submerged technologies will provide the greatest value to society and to the basic science enterprise.*

Second will be the utilization and leveraging of existing and emerging national and international activities to address global scientific and operational goals, working to strengthen the links between observatories. 
Many organizations and coordination projects are in place in the ocean community. 

Third will be a concerted effort to build capacity internationally to strengthen and operate the observation networks. 
The overall effect will be to establish a community of practice that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of a broader set of stakeholders that requires standardized ocean observations, but which today is unable to obtain these without specialized technical expertise.

Participant diversity is built into the RCN structure and will be expanded through active solicitations for additional membership. 
The RCN, including the Steering Committee, is constituted as an international forum with international membership. 
It includes participants from government, academic and national and international organizations, and the private sector. 
Industry engaged in using ocean information will be actively invited to the RCN through visibility at industry meetings with the help of IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society, the World Ocean Council, the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), and others. 
The RCN will interact with other organizations such as the international Group on Earth Observations. 

Young professionals, including those from under-represented groups or regions, will be identified for participation by the Steering Committee and senior investigators as noted in the section on Capacity Building. 
Initial Senior Network Investigators have agreed to serve as points of contact for under-represented groups. 
Through them and others in the network, individual contacts will be developed.  
Also, calls for Network participation will be made through presentations at major ocean science meetings such as AGU, EGU and ASLO. 
The PI will be the coordinator of these activities and existing senior members of the network will be the specific focal points for identified under-represented groups. 

## Happenings around the RCN

The [Open Data Working Group](working_groups/open_data_working_group/) (WG) published a paper on its finding and recommendations for open data.

The Working Group on synergies of Remote Sensing and In Situ ocean observations issued a report and recommendations for “A Modern Coastal Ocean Observing System Using Data from Advanced Satellite and In Situ Sensors – An Example” which looks at the next decade of observations in the context of coastal dynamics. A working group on sensors for ocean biology is examining the state of the art and trends for sensors and observations.

A Biological Integration and Observation (BIO) Task Team study sponsored by the IOOC has analyzed essential ocean variables for biology.

Does citizen science make significant contributions to scientific ocean research? This question is being addressed by an ***RCN citizen science working group***.
