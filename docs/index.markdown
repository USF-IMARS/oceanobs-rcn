The oceans provide many important functions within the Earth system including strong coupling with weather and climate dynamics,
providing food and energy resources, and supporting trade and commerce.
To understand the complex ocean environment better, multiple disciplines need to collaborate.

The goal of the Ocean Observation Research Coordination Network (RCN) is to foster a broad, multi-disciplinary dialogue,
enabling more effective use of ocean observing systems.
RCN will motivate new research outcomes, provide wider visibility for the value and impacts of ocean observations and encourage a new generation of scientists
to focus on the oceans and their challenges.


## Happenings around the RCN

The [Open Data Working Group](http://site.ieee.org/oceanrcn/working-groups/open-data-wg/) (WG) published a paper on its finding and recommendations for open data.

The Working Group on synergies of Remote Sensing and In Situ ocean observations issued a report and recommendations for “A Modern Coastal Ocean Observing System Using Data from Advanced Satellite and In Situ Sensors – An Example” which looks at the next decade of observations in the context of coastal dynamics. A working group on sensors for ocean biology is examining the state of the art and trends for sensors and observations.

A Biological Integration and Observation (BIO) Task Team study sponsored by the IOOC has analyzed essential ocean variables for biology.

Does citizen science make significant contributions to scientific ocean research? This question is being addressed by an ***RCN citizen science working group***.
